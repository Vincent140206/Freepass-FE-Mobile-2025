## 💡 What is BCC Freepas?

## 🎯 Challenge
To pass this free pass selection, you must complete one of the following challenges properly according to the requested criteria (Multi-Platform).

# 📱 Flutter Multi-Platform Technical Challenge

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a robust multi-platform application using **Flutter** that demonstrates proficiency in data management, API integration, and clean architecture.

---

## 🚀 Technical Requirements

### 1. Core Functionality
* **CRUD Operations**: The app must successfully execute **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** actions.
* **State Management**: Implement a scalable state management solution (e.g., Provider, Bloc, Riverpod, or GetX).
* **Local Persistence**: Integrate **Local Storage** (e.g., Hive, SQLite, or SharedPreferences) to ensure data remains available offline.

### 2. Networking & Data
* **API Integration**: Perform RESTful API calls using methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
* **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive logic to manage exceptions, such as network timeouts, API errors, and empty states.
* **Data Source**: You are free to use any [Public API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) or your own custom backend. 
    > **Note:** Evaluation focuses on your data handling logic and architecture rather than the API source itself.

### 3. User Interface (UI/UX)
While original UI design is not mandatory, the app should be polished and intuitive. You may use references from:
* [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) / [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)
* [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/) / [Screenlane](https://screenlane.com/)
  
#### Bonus Point
* Implement complex animations
* Add theme switching (e.g., light/dark mode)
* Ensure a responsive layout across screen sizes
